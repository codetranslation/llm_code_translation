The original code snippet is provided below. Please ensure the translated code maintains the same functionality and logic as the original.\n **Source Code ({source_lang}):** \n $```$ \n {source_code} \n $```$ \n **Target Language:** {target_lang} \n **Instructions for the Translator (LLM):** \n1. Ensure the translated code accurately reflects the functionality of the source code.\n2. Preserve naming conventions and comment styles appropriate to the {target_lang}.\n3. Include comments to explain any complex logic or necessary deviations from the source code structure due to language differences.\n4. Verify syntax and standard practices of {target_lang} are adhered to.\n5. Please provide any necessary explanations or assumptions made during translation as footnotes.\n **Output Requirement:** Please present the translated code in {target_lang}, including any necessary annotations or comments for clarity."}
